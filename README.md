# Loan Approval Prediction

Loans are a very important part of financial institutions.  By analyzing loans, decisions can be made to save the institution a lot of money while keeping their customer satisfaction up.  Using a dataset from India, the following questions drove the research for this project:
* What factors influence loan approval?
* Does credit history specifically impact the loan approval decision?
* What role does employment type (self-employed versus non self-employed) play in loan approval?
* Can we predict loan approval determination with high accuracy?
